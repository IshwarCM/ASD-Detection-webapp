# 🧠 Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Web App

This project is a machine learning-based **web application** designed to predict **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** in both **adults** and **children**. It uses models trained on screening data and provides a user-friendly interface to input relevant information and get predictive results.



## 📌 Project Overview

- Two separate machine learning models are trained: one for **adults** and one for **children**.
- The web app allows users to choose their category and input relevant screening information.
- Based on the input, the model returns whether the individual is likely to have ASD or not.


## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is taken from the **[UCI Machine Learning Repository – Autism Screening Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Autism+Screening+Adult)**. It contains various behavioral and demographic features useful for early screening of ASD.

Separate datasets were used for:
- Adults
- Children

Each dataset includes features like:
- Age  
- Gender  
- Jaundice at birth  
- Family history of ASD  
- Screening questions (A1–A10)  



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Flask** (for backend)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (for frontend)
- **Scikit-learn** (for ML models)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for training and evaluation)
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
